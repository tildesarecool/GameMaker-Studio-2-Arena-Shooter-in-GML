# GameMaker-Studio-2-Arena-Shooter-in-GML
I'm going to go through the arena shooter tutorial in GML.

I'm going to reference both the [GML "My first Areana Shooter - GML edition](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/tutorials/my-first-arena-shooter-gml) written tutorial, as well as the [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEb4gzG8S24&list=PLhIbBGhnxj5IcGWhJQNF5hScmCCn4M3xg).

The problem isthe youtube videos are from 2016 and both GMS2 and the GML language have changed since then. The written version - which is by a different author - doesn't have a date on it or any kind of hint of the last edit. So this will either be frustrating or really long and really frustrating.
